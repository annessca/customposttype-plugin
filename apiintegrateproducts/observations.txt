I noticed that it was not stated whether the custom taxonomies would be Hierarchical or Non-Hierarchical

It was also not clear if the required category taxonomy should have been made to fall under the inbuilt WordPress category.

I'm curious to know why the assessment had to contain so many parts. 


TIME ESTIMATED : 4 days because of other engagements and employment tests that I had to do.
ACTUAL TIME SPENT: 20th - 28th March 2023
FROM 2nd - 5th April: Spent researching and fixing errors. At some point, I slowed down and took my time because I figured you have already moved on with another candidate.


NOTE: I used Wordpress 6.1.1 
The latest WordPress was released on the 28th of March 2023. The site automatically updated itself and broke a few things. To get the best of this plugin, please stick to WordPress version 6.1.1

Place `define( 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', false );` in wp-config.php to prevent any automatic updates.
